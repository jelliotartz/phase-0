#####What does puts do?

Puts is ruby shorthand for "put string". It simply outputs its result to the console, rather than returning something (i.e., passing on information). It's a useful method for just seeing output in the console.


#####What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number *without* a decimal point. A float (or floating-point number) is a number *with* a decimal point (e.g., 5.3, 4.0, 7.36477).

#####What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division returns the quotient of two numbers using floating point numbers, and as many decimal places as are necessary. Integer division returns a quotient using no decimals, and rounds the quotient *down* to the nearest whole number.


#####Here are my ruby programs that calculate the number of hours in a year and number of minutes in a decade:

```ruby
puts 24*365
puts 60*24*365*10
```

#####How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby uses + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division.

#####What is the difference between integers and floats?

An integer is a number *without* a decimal point. A float (or floating-point number) is a number *with* a decimal point (e.g., 5.3, 4.0, 7.36477).

#####What is the difference between integer and float division?

Float division returns the quotient of two numbers using floating point numbers, and as many decimal places as are necessary. Integer division returns a quotient using no decimals, and rounds the quotient *down* to the nearest whole number.

#####What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are groups of letters. In Ruby, strings are defined using single quotation marks ('') at the beginning and end of the string. You use strings when you want to output and manipulate things other than numbers.

#####What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are strings or numbers stored in your computer's memory. In Ruby, storing a number or string as a variable is called *assigning* it to a variable. You assign strings and numbers to variables so that you can use them multiple times without having to write out the string/number each time.

#####How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Yep! Feels good to be back in Ruby-mode! :)
