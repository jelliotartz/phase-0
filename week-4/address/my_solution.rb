def make_address(a, b, c, d)
  a="633 Folsom St.".to_s
  b="San Francisco".to_s
  c="CA".to_s
  d="94107".to_s

  p "You live at #{a}, in the beautiful city of #{b}, #{c}. Your zip is #{d}."

end

# "You live at 633 Folsom St., in the beautiful city of San Francisco, CA. Your zip is 94107."
# "You live at 633 Folsom St., in the beautiful city of San Francisco, CA. Your zip is 94107."
