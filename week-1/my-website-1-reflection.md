# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

1. create a repository on GitHub
  1. click the '+' icon in the upper right corner of your homepage on GitHub.com
  2. select 'new repository' from the dropbox
  3. select a name for your repository
  4. choose public or private visibility for your new repository
  5. choose whether to include a readme file
  6. choose whether to include a license or .gitignore
  7. when you're finished, click the green 'create repository' button below

2. clone the repository to your local computer
  1. navigate to your repository on GitHub.com
  2. near the lower right corner, locate the 'clone URL' feature
  3. click on it so that it is highlighted
  4. copy the highlighted text to your clipboard. Make sure to copy the entire link, it is longer than the dialogue box!
  5. open the CLI on your local computer
  6. navigate to the directory where you want to clone your GitHub repository
    * you may want to create a branch directory on which to do your work
  7. once you are in the directory where you want to work, type git clone [paste your GitHub repository URL here]
    * do not include the brackets

# Describe what open source means.

Open source software allows anyone to view the code that created the program (the source code). Anyone can customize the source code if they see fit.

# What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think it is a good idea. I'm sure that there have been abuses of the ability to view and edit source code, but overall I think that the risk is worth the reward. I realize that the open source philosophy is responsible for much of the software that I use being free, and I respect and appreciate that.

# Assess the importance of using licenses.

Without having much knowledge on the matter, licencing seems like a good corollary to Open Source software. It should ideally give the creator the ability to keep others from profiting off of their intellectual property.

# What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The challenge gave us an opportunity to practice creating a repository on GitHub, moving it to our local computer, working on it, and then moving it back to GitHub. We also scratched the surface of putting content on the web via our GitHub pages account.

The first few times that I moved content back and forth from GitHub to my local device, I had some struggles with the branch and master directories. I kept getting error messages, and then I realized that I had created an extra phase-0 directory on my local device, which was causing problems. Eventually I worked through the issue, and then I practiced creating branch directories, creating and merging pull requests, and viewing the changes on my GitHub pages account. I feel *somewhat* confidant with the process, and am looking forward to more practice!

# Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I followed a lot of the links in the challenge, but didn't find the need to go out on my own yet. I've done some searching to answer other questions at various points throughout the week 1 exercises, and have had some success finding resources on my own. It's another skill that I'm looking forward to improving!
