<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was pretty neat. I didn't catch the part of the instructions that said not to worry about making the links active until I was almost done, so I ended up spending a bunch of time copying the link addresses, which made the challenge take a while. So besides making myself take a bunch of time, it was fine.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Good. I'm not sure I utilized all the elements that HTML5 has to offer though. Mostly I used <li>, <span>, and <a href>. I did use <aside>, <header> and <footer> though, which I know are new HTML5 elements.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Good. There is absolutely no formatting in this webpage.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I'm still pretty impressed by the idea of actually writing HTML and having it appear on a webpage. It's a real feeling of accomplishment. As far as good and bad, I'm not sure I have enough experience to say. And there's not really an alternative to HTML at this point, right? I can't really imagine what an alternative would look like...

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

1. Always close the tags. I like how Sublime 'autocompletes' my close tags for me, although I kinda feel like this is cheating a bit.

2. At this point I feel like repetition is the biggest key to remembering/learning how to write HTML. At some points this exercise felt tedious, but actually writing out the HTML is certainly a good way to remember it.
