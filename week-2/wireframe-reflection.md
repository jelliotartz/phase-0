Here is a [link](/week-2/wireframe-index.png) (using inline markdown!) to an image of my wireframe index! I used Mockingbird to create my wireframes, so if you'd like to see the actual webpage, [click here](https://gomockingbird.com/projects/0koopa7/4gXVnC)

Here is a [link](/week-2/wireframe-blog-index.png) to an image of my wireframe blog index! [Here's](https://gomockingbird.com/projects/0koopa7/TnMd3U) the Mockingbird site for this wireframe.


#### What is a wireframe?

A wireframe allows you to define information, hierarchically, that you want to display on a website (or in an application, or software program). A wireframe provides the medium for you to organize your layout according to how you want your users to process the information on your webpage.

#### What are the benefits of wireframing?

After deciding what is the primary goal or purpose of the website, creating a wireframe provides an opportunity to visually organize how I envision the website being displayed.


#### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Somewhat. I'm not particularly happy with the product that I created, but at this point I'm not really sure what to do about it. Will I be able to make it look more attractive once I get to CSS? What do I really *want* it to look like? I haven't had a lot of practice or experience with designing things before, so it's kinda hard for me to just create a wireframe that is pleasing to my eye - or, perhaps more importantly, accomplishes the primary goal that I want my website to achieve (provide information about myself, present myself to future perspective employers).


#### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I've done some revision, mostly to the main site index page. The blog index wireframe is really basic, and at this point I'm thinking of it as just a visual representation of the idea that I'll have 7 blog posts at the end of Phase 0.

Unfortunately I only have 6 days before [Mockingbird](www.gomockingbird.com) will make my wireframes into read-only files. Maybe by then I'll be way past the wireframe stage and it won't be important at that point. I'm hoping that I'll finish this week's work with enough time to go back to these wireframes and revise them some more.

#### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I followed the suggestion to checkout [Wirifry](http://www.wirify.com/), which I thought was pretty neat. It really helped me to appreciate and understand what a wireframe is and how it relates to literally every page that I visit on the web.

Besides Wirifry, I checked out all of the resources suggested in the wireframing challenge. I learned a lot from these resources, but I didn't really come up with any questions that weren't answered by the resources.

#### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I found the wireframe creation process challenging, in the sense that so far I've approached DBC challenges as learning new skills (applications such as Sublime, code language basics, CLI language, git and GitHub workflow, etc). Wireframing and website development are also a new skills, but they involve a creative aspect that wasn't present in the Week 1 material. I'll be continuing to think more about how I want my website to look, and how it will best accomplish the goals that I want to use it for (putting out info about myself, getting a job).

Did I enjoy wireframing? Kind of. At this point I don't know if website design is where I see myself after finishing DBC. It wouldn't be the worst job ever. I could see myself enjoying the creative design process. Do I *love* it? I think there are other parts of the development process, specifically things that are more related to using/writing/editing code (back-end development?) that I think I might enjoy more. I'm keeping an open mind at this point though.
