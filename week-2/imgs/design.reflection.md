### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of web design are as follows:

1. Information Gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance

### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my site is to provide information about myself. My site will feature my cv, links to examples of my work, and ways for people to contact me.

### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is future employers. My site will address them in a fun yet professional manner.

# What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action users will hopefully take at my site is to see my portfolio, and then want to contact me.

### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Jacob Gube [defines](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/what-is-user-experience-design-overview-tools-and-resources)  user experience as "...how a person feels when interfacing with a system. The system could be a website, a web application or desktop software and, in modern contexts, is generally denoted by some form of human-computer interaction (HCI)."

According to Gube, user experience (UX) is becoming an integral component in the process of website and software design. Since it is a relatively new term and 'sub-field' within the industry, some companies and people do not think it is important to have a UX designer on their team, particularly if they built successful sites and products without devoting resources specifically to UX. But as technology becomes more entwined in all aspects of our daily lives, it is becoming harder to deny the importance of UX to the design process, and perhaps more importantly, to the marketability of a company's product.

### What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

Again, Jacob Gube:
> a website’s success still hinges on just one thing: how users perceive it. “Does this website give me value? Is it easy to use? Is it pleasant to use?” These are the questions that run through the minds of visitors as they interact with our products, and they form the basis of their decisions on whether to become regular users. User experience design is all about striving to make them answer “Yes” to all of those questions.

User experience design is valuable if a company seeks to acquire regular users. Since there are few reasons why this would not be the case, it is hard to argue against the value of a position that seeks to help a company reach this goal. As more companies and products compete to acquire regular users of their products, UX designers will become more integral to the design process.

### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I had a hard time creating a picture of my site map. I used [writemaps](https://www.writemaps.com/), and after creating the site map, my only two options for sharing it were as a .csv file or copying the XML. Unfortunately at this point I don't know how to turn either of those options into a .png file or any other kind of image. So I cheated and took a screen shot of the webpage :(  I'm sorry, I had hoped to have time to ask my guide about it last night in my GPS, but unfortunately I didn't have time. And yes, I know, I'm only cheating myself. I will figure this out. Just not now. Sorry!!!
