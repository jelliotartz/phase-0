 // Design Basic Game Solo Challenge

// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description:
// Overall mission: Secure the Ark of the Covenant
// Goals: Find the Ark, avoid the Nazi.
// Characters: Indiana Jones, Nazi
// Objects: Ark of the Covenant.
// Functions: moveUp, moveDown, moveForward, moveBack

/*
Pseudocode

Create a player, "Indiana Jones," that will be able to move around a coordinate plane (up, down, forward, back).

Create four methods that will execute movement in these four directions.

Create a "Nazi" object and give it a random position.

Create an "Ark of the Covenant" object and give it a random position. This position will be fixed throughout the duration of the game.

Move Indiana Jones, and randomly reassign the position of the Nazi.

Check where Indiana Jones is in relation to the Nazi and the Ark.

Accept input for next move of Indiana Jones, UNTIL:

  If Indiana Jones moves and his grid coordinates are the same as the Ark, success!

    Output pithy "you won the game" message. END.

  If Indiana Jones moves and his grid coordinates are the same as the Nazi's, failure!

    Output pithy "you lost the game" message. END.
